WEARECARS APPLICATION - DEBUG FIXES APPLIED
============================================
Date: December 8, 2025

ISSUES FIXED:
============

1. WINDOW INTERACTION ISSUES
   - Removed problematic `grab_set()` calls that were blocking user interaction
   - Removed `transient(parent)` dependencies on withdrawn root window
   - All windows now properly respond to mouse clicks and keyboard input

2. MINIMIZE/MAXIMIZE BUTTON ISSUES
   - Removed `resizable(False, False)` restrictions that were hiding window controls
   - All windows now have standard Windows controls (minimize, maximize, close)
   - Users can now resize windows as needed

3. ABNORMAL WINDOW BEHAVIOR
   - Added proper window protocol handlers (WM_DELETE_WINDOW)
   - Implemented `-topmost` attribute temporarily on startup for better focus
   - Added minimum window sizes to prevent UI elements from being hidden
   - Proper window lifecycle management prevents random maximize/minimize

4. BUTTON VISIBILITY IN BOOKING WIZARD
   - Fixed layout order: navigation buttons now packed with side='bottom'
   - Increased window height from 700px to 750px

5. VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS
   - Enhanced customer detail validation with visual feedback
   - Fields turn red/pink when invalid
   - Consolidated error messages show all validation issues at once

   - Prevents multiple booking wizards from opening simultaneously
   - Properly closes child windows when parent closes
   - No orphaned windows left open

7. FOCUS AND STABILITY
